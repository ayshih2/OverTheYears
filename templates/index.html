          <p>Inspired by <a href="https://pudding.cool">The Pudding</a>, here is a data driven analysis of the discography of one of the biggest global artists in the world: BTS. A short introduction
            for those unaware: BTS, or Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단), is a South Korean boy group who debuted under BigHit Entertainment in 2013 with the album
            <em>2 Cool 4 Skool</em>. The group consists of seven members: RM (Kim Namjoon), Jin (Kim Seokjin), Suga (Min Yoongi), j-hope (Jung Hoseok), 
            Jimin (Park Jimin), V (Kim Taehyung), and Jungkook (Jeon Jungkook). Since their debut, they've released BLANK albums (? of which are Korean albums while
            ? are Japanese albums) and have experience exponential growth with each release. Their first breakthrough was with the single I Need U in Korea while
            they've been making waves in the US ever since the release of DNA. 
            <br><br>
            They're undoubtably the biggest musical group in the world right now, trailblazers in the music industry, and along with the fame comes the 
            inevitable question: what makes them so popular? The answer is simpler than you think: their music. 
            <br><br>
            There are numerous reasons why music resonates with others, but here are some of the insights backed by data. We'll be primarily looking at data
            from three sources: Spotify (for the audio features), MusixMatch (for the lyrics), and Microsoft Azure (to perform sentiment analysis on
            the Korean lyrics). Is it your first time with BTS? 
            Let's dive into BTS' discography and analyze how it has changed <b>over the years</b>!

                <p>Along with separating tracks by album, now let's separate them by

                <p>Though it varies from person to person, certain keys elict certain
                  emotions from people; songs written in minor keys are often linked to be
                  more negative emotions while the opposite is true for major keys.

          <canvas class="speechiness-chart"></canvas>
          <p>Speechiness is an audio feature provided by Spotify whose value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where the higher the value, the more
            spoken words is detected in the track. You can tell how this correlates with BTS' change in sound--from their earlier tracks having more of a 
            hip hop influence while their current tracks are more pop inspired. Spotify describes values between 0.33 - 0.66 as tracks that contain both
            speech and music--such as rap songs.

            The peak in MOTS : Persona is due to it being an EP. Explain more lol.
